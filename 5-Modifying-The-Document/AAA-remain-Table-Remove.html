        /*
        The HTML in the task is incorrect. That’s the reason of the odd thing.

        The browser has to fix it automatically. But 
        there may be no text inside the <table>: according to
        the spec only table-specific tags are allowed. So 
        the browser shows "aaa" before the <table>.

        Now it’s obvious that when we remove the table, it remains.

        The question can be easily answered by exploring the 
        DOM using the browser tools. You’ll see "aaa" before the <table>.

        The HTML standard specifies in detail how to process 
        bad HTML, and such behavior of the browser is correct.
