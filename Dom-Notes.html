        At the time of <script> execution the last DOM 
            node is exactly <script>, because the browser did 
                not process the rest of the page yet.

        So the result is 1 (element node).
        The nodeType property provides one more, “old-fashioned” way to get the “type” of a DOM node.

        It has a numeric value:

        elem.nodeType == 1 for element nodes,
        elem.nodeType == 3 for text nodes,
        elem.nodeType == 9 for the document object,

        */

        let body = document.body;

        body.innerHTML = "<!--" + body.tagName + "-->";

        alert( body.firstChild.data ); // BODY

        /*
        What’s going on step by step:

        The content of <body> is replaced with the comment. The comment is <!--BODY-->, because body.tagName == "BODY". As we remember, tagName is always uppercase in HTML.
        The comment is now the only child node, so we get it in body.firstChild.
        The data property of the comment is its contents (inside <!--...-->): "BODY".
        */

        alert(document); // [object HTMLDocument]
        alert(document.constructor.name); // HTMLDocument

        /*
        So, document is an instance of HTMLDocument class.

        What’s its place in the hierarchy?

        Yeah, we could browse the specification, 
        but it would be faster to figure out manually.

        Let’s traverse the prototype chain via __proto__.

        As we know, methods of a class are in the prototype 
        of the constructor. For instance, HTMLDocument.prototype
         has methods for documents.

        Also, there’s a reference to the constructor 
        function inside the prototype:
        */
        alert(HTMLDocument.prototype.constructor === HTMLDocument); // true

        alert(HTMLDocument.prototype.constructor.name); // HTMLDocument
        alert(HTMLDocument.prototype.__proto__.constructor.name); // Document
        alert(HTMLDocument.prototype.__proto__.__proto__.constructor.name); // Node

        /*
Given a DOM node, we can go to its immediate neighbors using navigation properties.

There are two main sets of them:

For all nodes: parentNode, childNodes, firstChild, lastChild, previousSibling, 
nextSibling.
For element nodes only: parentElement, children, firstElementChild, lastElementChild, 
previousElementSibling, nextElementSibling


There are 6 main methods to search for nodes in DOM:

Method	Searches by...	Can call on an element?	Live?
querySelector	CSS-selector	✔	-
querySelectorAll	CSS-selector	✔	-
getElementById	id	-	-
getElementsByName	name	-	✔
getElementsByTagName	tag or '*'	✔	✔
getElementsByClassName	class	✔	✔
By far the most used are querySelector and querySelectorAll, 
but getElement(s)By* can be sporadically helpful or found in the old scripts.

Besides that:

There is elem.matches(css) to check if elem matches the given CSS selector.
There is elem.closest(css) to look for the nearest ancestor that matches 
the given CSS-selector. The elem itself is also checked.
And let’s mention one more method here to check for the child-parent 
relationship, as it’s sometimes useful:

elemA.contains(elemB) returns true if elemB is inside elemA 
(a descendant of elemA) or when elemA==elemB.




        Each DOM node belongs to a certain class. The classes form a hierarchy. 
        The full set of properties and methods come as the result of inheritance.

Main DOM node properties are:

nodeType
We can use it to see if a node is a text or an element node. 
It has a numeric value: 1 for elements,3 for text nodes, 
and a few others for other node types. Read-only.

nodeName/tagName
For elements, tag name (uppercased unless XML-mode). 
For non-element nodes nodeName describes what it is. Read-only.

innerHTML
The HTML content of the element. Can be modified.

outerHTML
The full HTML of the element. A write operation 
into elem.outerHTML does not touch elem itself. Instead 
it gets replaced with the new HTML in the outer context.

nodeValue/data
The content of a non-element node (text, comment). 
These two are almost the same, usually we use data. Can be modified.

textContent
The text inside the element: HTML minus all <tags>. 
    Writing into it puts the text inside the element, 
    with all special characters and tags treated exactly as text. 
    Can safely insert user-generated text and protect from unwanted HTML insertions.

hidden
When set to true, does the same as CSS display:none.
DOM nodes also have other properties depending on 
their class. For instance, <input> elements (HTMLInputElement)
 support value, type, while <a> elements (HTMLAnchorElement) support href etc.
     Most standard HTML attributes have a corresponding DOM property.

However, HTML attributes and DOM properties are 
not always the same, as we’ll see in the next chapter.

Attributes – is what’s written in HTML.
Properties – is what’s in DOM objects.
A small comparison:

Properties	                                                            Attributes
Type	Any value, standard properties have types described in the spec	A string
Name	Name is case-sensitive	                                Name is not case-sensitive
Methods to work with attributes are:

elem.hasAttribute(name) – to check for existence.
elem.getAttribute(name) – to get the value.
elem.setAttribute(name, value) – to set the value.
elem.removeAttribute(name) – to remove the attribute.
elem.attributes is a collection of all attributes.
For most situations using DOM properties is preferable. 
We should refer to attributes only when DOM properties 
do not suit us, when we need exactly attributes, for instance:

We need a non-standard attribute. But if it starts with data-, 
then we should use dataset.
We want to read the value “as written” in HTML. The value of 
the DOM property may be different, for instance the href property
is always a full URL, and we may want to get the “original” value.



Methods to create new nodes:

document.createElement(tag) – creates an element with the given tag,
document.createTextNode(value) – creates a text node (rarely used),
elem.cloneNode(deep) – clones the element, if deep==true then 
with all descendants.
Insertion and removal:

node.append(...nodes or strings) – insert into node, at the end,
node.prepend(...nodes or strings) – insert into node, at the beginning,
node.before(...nodes or strings) –- insert right before node,
node.after(...nodes or strings) –- insert right after node,
node.replaceWith(...nodes or strings) –- replace node.
node.remove() –- remove the node.
Text strings are inserted “as text”.

There are also “old school” methods:

parent.appendChild(node)
parent.insertBefore(node, nextSibling)
parent.removeChild(node)
parent.replaceChild(newElem, node)
All these methods return node.

Given some HTML in html, elem.insertAdjacentHTML(where, html) inserts 
it depending on the value of where:

"beforebegin" – insert html right before elem,
"afterbegin" – insert html into elem, at the beginning,
"beforeend" – insert html into elem, at the end,
"afterend" – insert html right after elem.
Also there are similar methods, elem.insertAdjacentText and 
elem.insertAdjacentElement, that insert text strings and elements, 
but they are rarely used.

To append HTML to the page before it has finished loading:

document.write(html)
After the page is loaded such a call erases the document. Mostly 
seen in old scripts.

To manage classes, there are two DOM properties:

className – the string value, good to manage the whole set of classes.
classList – the object with methods add/remove/toggle/contains, good 
for individual classes.
To change the styles:

The style property is an object with camelCased styles. 
Reading and writing to it has the same meaning as modifying 
individual properties in the "style" attribute. To see how 
to apply important and other rare stuff – there’s a list of methods at MDN.

The style.cssText property corresponds to the whole "style" 
attribute, the full string of styles.

To read the resolved styles (with respect to all classes, 
after all CSS is applied and final values are calculated):

The getComputedStyle(elem, [pseudo]) returns the style-like object 
with them. Read-only.

Elements have the following geometry properties:

offsetParent – is the nearest positioned ancestor or td, th, table, body.

offsetLeft/offsetTop – coordinates relative to the upper-left edge of 
                        offsetParent.

offsetWidth/offsetHeight – “outer” width/height of an element including 
                        borders.

clientLeft/clientTop – the distances from the upper-left outer corner 
to the upper-left inner (content + padding) corner. 
For left-to-right OS they are always the widths of 
left/top borders. For right-to-left OS the vertical 
scrollbar is on the left so clientLeft includes its width too.

clientWidth/clientHeight – the width/height of the content including 
paddings, but without the scrollbar.

scrollWidth/scrollHeight – the width/height of the content, 
just like clientWidth/clientHeight, but also include scrolled-out, 
invisible part of the element.

scrollLeft/scrollTop – width/height of the scrolled out upper part 
of the element, starting from its upper-left corner.

All properties are read-only except scrollLeft/scrollTop that make the 
browser scroll the element if changed.

Geometry:

Width/height of the visible part of the document (content area 
width/height): document.documentElement.clientWidth/clientHeight

Width/height of the whole document, with the scrolled out part:

let scrollHeight = Math.max(
  document.body.scrollHeight, document.documentElement.scrollHeight,
  document.body.offsetHeight, document.documentElement.offsetHeight,
  document.body.clientHeight, document.documentElement.clientHeight
);
Scrolling:

Read the current scroll: window.pageYOffset/pageXOffset.

Change the current scroll:

window.scrollTo(pageX,pageY) – absolute coordinates,
window.scrollBy(x,y) – scroll relative the current place,
elem.scrollIntoView(top) – scroll to make elem visible (align with 
the top/bottom of the window).

Any point on the page has coordinates:

Relative to the window – elem.getBoundingClientRect().
Relative to the document – elem.getBoundingClientRect() plus the current page scroll.
Window coordinates are great to use with position:fixed, and document coordinates 
do well with position:absolute.

Both coordinate systems have their pros and cons; there are times we need one 
or the other one, just like CSS position absolute and fixed.

The two coordinate systems are connected by the formula:

pageY = clientY + height of the scrolled-out vertical part of the document.
pageX = clientX + width of the scrolled-out horizontal part of the document.

There are 3 ways to assign event handlers:

HTML attribute: onclick="...".
DOM property: elem.onclick = function.
Methods: elem.addEventListener(event, handler[, phase]) to add, 
removeEventListener to remove.
HTML attributes are used sparingly, because JavaScript in the middle of an HTML 
tag looks a little bit odd and alien. Also can’t write lots of code in there.

DOM properties are ok to use, but we can’t assign more than one handler of the 
particular event. In many cases that limitation is not pressing.

The last way is the most flexible, but it is also the longest to write. There 
are few events that only work with it, for instance transitionend and 
DOMContentLoaded (to be covered). Also addEventListener supports objects 
as event handlers. In that case the method handleEvent is called in case of the event.

No matter how you assign the handler – it gets an event object as the first 
argument. That object contains the details about what’s happened.

There are many default browser actions:

mousedown – starts the selection (move the mouse to select).
click on <input type="checkbox"> – checks/unchecks the input.
submit – clicking an <input type="submit"> or hitting Enter inside a form field causes this event to happen, and the browser submits the form after it.
keydown – pressing a key may lead to adding a character into a field, or other actions.
contextmenu – the event happens on a right-click, the action is to show the browser context menu.
…there are more…
All the default actions can be prevented if we want to handle the event exclusively by JavaScript.

To prevent a default action – use either event.preventDefault() or return false. 
The second method works only for handlers assigned with on<event>.

The passive: true option of addEventListener tells the browser that the 
action is not going to be prevented. That’s useful for some mobile events, 
like touchstart and touchmove, to tell the browser that it should not wait 
for all handlers to finish before scrolling.

If the default action was prevented, the value of event.defaultPrevented 
becomes true, otherwise it’s false.

Stay semantic, don’t abuse
Technically, by preventing default actions and adding JavaScript we 
can customize the behavior of any elements. For instance, we can make 
a link <a> work like a button, and a button <button> behave as a link 
    (redirect to another URL or so).

But we should generally keep the semantic meaning of HTML elements. 
For instance, <a> should perform navigation, not a button.

Besides being “just a good thing”, that makes your HTML better in 
terms of accessibility.

Also if we consider the example with <a>, then please note: a 
    browser allows us to open such links in a new window (by right-
    clicking them and other means). And people like that. But if 
    we make a button behave as a link using JavaScript and even look 
    like a link using CSS, then <a>-specific browser features still 
        won’t work for it.

To generate an event from code, we first need to create an event object.

The generic Event(name, options) constructor accepts an arbitrary event 
name and the options object with two properties:

bubbles: true if the event should bubble.
cancelable: true if the event.preventDefault() should work.
Other constructors of native events like MouseEvent, KeyboardEvent and 
so on accept properties specific to that event type. For instance, 
clientX for mouse events.

For custom events we should use CustomEvent constructor. It has an 
additional option named detail, we should assign the event-specific 
data to it. Then all handlers can access it as event.detail.

Despite the technical possibility of generating browser events like click 
or keydown, we should use them with great care.

We shouldn’t generate browser events as it’s a hacky way to run 
handlers. That’s bad architecture most of the time.

Native events might be generated:

As a dirty hack to make 3rd-party libraries work the needed way, 
if they don’t provide other means of interaction.
For automated testing, to “click the button” in the script and 
see if the interface reacts correctly.
Custom events with our own names are often generated for architectural 
purposes, to signal what happens inside our menus, sliders, carousels etc.

Mouse events have the following properties:

Button: button.

Modifier keys (true if pressed): altKey, ctrlKey, shiftKey and metaKey (Mac).

If you want to handle Ctrl, then don’t forget Mac users, they usually 
use Cmd, so it’s better to check if (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey).
Window-relative coordinates: clientX/clientY.

Document-relative coordinates: pageX/pageY.

The default browser action of mousedown is text selection, if it’s not 
good for the interface, then it should be prevented.

events mouseover, mouseout, mousemove, mouseenter and mouseleave.

These things are good to note:

A fast mouse move may skip intermediate elements.
Events mouseover/out and mouseenter/leave have an additional property: 
relatedTarget. That’s the element that we are coming from/to, 
complementary to target.
Events mouseover/out trigger even when we go from the parent element 
to a child element. The browser assumes that the mouse can be only 
over one element at one time – the deepest one.

Events mouseenter/leave are different in that aspect: they only 
trigger when the mouse comes in and out the element as a whole. 
Also they do not bubble.

We considered a basic Drag’n’Drop algorithm.

The key components:

Events flow: ball.mousedown → document.mousemove → ball.mouseup (don’t forget 
to cancel native ondragstart).
At the drag start – remember the initial shift of the pointer relative 
to the element: shiftX/shiftY and keep it during the dragging.
Detect droppable elements under the pointer using document.elementFromPoint.
We can lay a lot on this foundation.

On mouseup we can intellectually finalize the drop: change data, move elements around.
We can highlight the elements we’re flying over.
We can limit dragging by a certain area or direction.
We can use event delegation for mousedown/up. A large-area event handler that 
checks event.target can manage Drag’n’Drop for hundreds of elements.
And so on.
There are frameworks that build architecture over it: DragZone, Droppable,
 Draggable and other classes. Most of them do the similar stuff to what’s 
 described above, so it should be easy to understand them now. Or roll your 
 own, as you can see that that’s easy enough to do, sometimes easier than 
 adapting a third-party solution.

 Pointer events allow handling mouse, touch and pen events simultaneously, with 
 a single piece of code.

Pointer events extend mouse events. We can replace mouse with pointer in event 
names and expect our code to continue working for mouse, with better support 
for other device types.

For drag’n’drops and complex touch interactions that the browser may decide 
to hijack and handle on its own – remember to cancel the default action on 
events and set touch-action: none in CSS for elements that we engage.

Additional abilities of pointer events are:

Multi-touch support using pointerId and isPrimary.
Device-specific properties, such as pressure, width/height, and others.
Pointer capturing: we can retarget all pointer events to a specific element 
until pointerup/pointercancel.
As of now, pointer events are supported in all major browsers, so we can 
safely switch to them, especially if IE10- and Safari 12- are not needed. 
And even with those browsers, there are polyfills that enable the support 
of pointer events.

Pressing a key always generates a keyboard event, be it symbol keys or 
special keys like Shift or Ctrl and so on. The only exception is Fn key 
that sometimes presents on a laptop keyboard. There’s no keyboard event 
for it, because it’s often implemented on lower level than OS.

Keyboard events:

keydown – on pressing the key (auto-repeats if the key is pressed for long),
keyup – on releasing the key.
Main keyboard event properties:

code – the “key code” ("KeyA", "ArrowLeft" and so on), specific to the 
physical location of the key on keyboard.
key – the character ("A", "a" and so on), for non-character keys, such as 
Esc, usually has the same value as code.
In the past, keyboard events were sometimes used to track user input in 
form fields. That’s not reliable, because the input can come from various 
sources. We have input and change events to handle any input (covered later 
in the chapter Events: change, input, cut, copy, paste). They trigger
 after any kind of input, including copy-pasting or speech recognition.

We should use keyboard events when we really want keyboard. For example, 
to react on hotkeys or special keys.

Form navigation:

document.forms
A form is available as document.forms[name/index].
form.elements
Form elements are available as form.elements[name/index], or can use 
just form[name/index]. The elements property also works for <fieldset>.
element.form
Elements reference their form in the form property.
Value is available as input.value, textarea.value, select.value, etc. 
(For checkboxes and radio buttons, use input.checked to determine 
whether a value is selected.)

For <select>, one can also get the value by the index select.selectedIndex 
    or through the options collection select.options.

Events focus and blur trigger on an element focusing/losing focus.

Their specials are:

They do not bubble. Can use capturing state instead or focusin/focusout.
Most elements do not support focus by default. Use tabindex to make 
anything focusable.
The current focused element is available as document.activeElement.

Data change events:

Event	Description	Specials
change	A value was changed.	For text inputs triggers on focus loss.
input	For text inputs on every change.	Triggers immediately unlike change.
cut/copy/paste	Cut/copy/paste actions.	The action can be prevented. 
The event.clipboardData property gives access to the clipboard. All browsers 
except Firefox also support navigator.clipboard.

Page load events:

The DOMContentLoaded event triggers on document when the DOM is ready. We can 
apply JavaScript to elements at this stage.
Script such as script/script or script src="..."/script block DOMContentLoaded,
 the browser waits for them to execute.
Images and other resources may also still continue loading.
The load event on window triggers when the page and all resources are loaded. 
We rarely use it, because there’s usually no need to wait for so long.
The beforeunload event on window triggers when the user wants to leave the 
page. If we cancel the event, browser asks whether the user really wants 
to leave (e.g we have unsaved changes).
The unload event on window triggers when the user is finally leaving, 
in the handler we can only do simple things that do not involve delays or 
asking a user. Because of that limitation, it’s rarely used. We can send out a
 network request with navigator.sendBeacon.
document.readyState is the current state of the document, changes can be 
tracked in the readystatechange event:
loading – the document is loading.
interactive – the document is parsed, happens at about the same time as 
DOMContentLoaded, but before it.
complete – the document and resources are loaded, happens at about the 
same time as window.onload, but before it.

Both async and defer have one common thing: downloading of such scripts doesn’t 
block page rendering. So the user can read page content and get 
acquainted with the page immediately.

But there are also essential differences between them:

Order	DOMContentLoaded
async	Load-first order. Their document order doesn’t matter – which loads first runs first	
Irrelevant. May load and execute while the document has not yet been fully downloaded. 
That happens if scripts are small or cached, and the document is long enough.
defer	Document order (as they go in the document).	Execute after the document is 
loaded and parsed (they wait if needed), right before DOMContentLoaded.
In practice, defer is used for scripts that need the whole DOM and/or their relative 
execution order is important.

And async is used for independent scripts, like counters or ads. And their 
relative execution order does not matter.

Page without scripts should be usable
Please note: if you’re using defer or async, then user will see the page before 
the script loads.

In such case, some graphical components are probably not initialized yet.

Don’t forget to put “loading” indication and disable buttons that aren’t 
functional yet. Let the user clearly see what he can do on the page, and 
what’s still getting ready.

Images <img>, external styles, scripts and other resources provide load and error 
events to track their loading:

load triggers on a successful load,
error triggers on a failed load.
The only exception is <iframe>: for historical reasons it always triggers load, 
    for any load completion, even if the page is not found.

The readystatechange event also works for resources, but is rarely used, because 
load/error events are simpler.
