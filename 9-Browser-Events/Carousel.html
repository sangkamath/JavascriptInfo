The images ribbon can be represented as ul/li list of images <img>.

Normally, such a ribbon is wide, but we put a fixed-size <div> 
    around to “cut” it, so that only a part of the ribbon is visible:


To make the list show horizontally we need to apply correct CSS 
properties for <li>, like display: inline-block.

For <img> we should also adjust display, because by default 
it’s inline. There’s extra space reserved under inline elements 
for “letter tails”, so we can use display:block to remove it.

To do the scrolling, we can shift <ul>. There are many ways 
    to do it, for instance by changing margin-left or 
    (better performance) use transform: translateX():


The outer <div> has a fixed width, so “extra” images are cut.

The whole carousel is a self-contained “graphical component” on 
the page, so we’d better wrap it into a single <div class="carousel"> 
    and style things inside it.

When an event happens – the most nested element where it happens 
gets labeled as the “target element” (event.target).

Then the event moves down from the document root to event.target, 
calling handlers assigned with addEventListener(..., true) on the 
way (true is a shorthand for {capture: true}).
Then handlers are called on the target element itself.
Then the event bubbles up from event.target to the root, calling 
handlers assigned using on<event>, HTML attributes and addEventListener 
    without the 3rd argument or with the 3rd argument false/{capture:false}.
Each handler can access event object properties:

event.target – the deepest element that originated the event.
event.currentTarget (=this) – the current element that handles the 
event (the one that has the handler on it)
event.eventPhase – the current phase (capturing=1, target=2, bubbling=3).
Any event handler can stop the event by calling event.stopPropagation(), 
but that’s not recommended, because we can’t really be sure we won’t 
need it above, maybe for completely different things.

The capturing phase is used very rarely, usually we handle events 
on bubbling. And there’s a logical explanation for that.

In real world, when an accident happens, local authorities react 
first. They know best the area where it happened. Then higher-level 
authorities if needed.

The same for event handlers. The code that set the handler on a 
particular element knows maximum details about the element and 
what it does. A handler on a particular <td> may be suited for 
    that exactly <td>, it knows everything about it, so it should 
        get the chance first. Then its immediate parent also 
        knows about the context, but a little bit less, and so 
        on till the very top element that handles general concepts and runs the last one.

Bubbling and capturing lay the foundation for “event delegation” – 
an extremely powerful event handling pattern that we study in the next chapter.

Event delegation is really cool! It’s one of the most helpful patterns for DOM events.

It’s often used to add the same handling for many similar elements, but not only for that.

The algorithm:

Put a single handler on the container.
In the handler – check the source element event.target.
If the event happened inside an element that interests us, then handle the event.
Benefits:

Simplifies initialization and saves memory: no need to add many handlers.
Less code: when adding or removing elements, no need to add/remove handlers.
DOM modifications: we can mass add/remove elements with innerHTML and the like.
The delegation has its limitations of course:

First, the event must be bubbling. Some events do not bubble. Also, low-level handlers 
should not use event.stopPropagation().
Second, the delegation may add CPU load, because the container-level handler reacts 
on events in any place of the container, no matter whether they interest us or not. 
But usually the load is negligible, so we don’t take it into account.
