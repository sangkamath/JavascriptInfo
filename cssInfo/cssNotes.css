/*Flexbox is short for the Flexible Box Layout module.

Flexbox is a layout method for arranging items in rows
 or columns.

Flexbox makes it easier to design a flexible responsive
layout structure, without using float or positioning.

The CSS Flexbox Layout should be used for one-dimensional 
layout, with rows OR columns.

The CSS Grid Layout should be used for two-dimensional 
layout, with rows AND columns.

Before the Flexible Box Layout module, there were four 
layout modes:

Block, for sections in a webpage
Inline, for text
Table, for two-dimensional table data
Positioned, for explicit position of an element
